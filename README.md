# Drive Wheel Motor Torque Calculations
Determine whether a robot vehicle drive system have enough surface traction to achieve the desired speed and acceleration without slipping. These calculations are derived by examining the robot weight, type of surface and angle of incline robot is expected to climb.

The formulas and calculations outlined follow the 2011 paper submitted by the [Manufacturing Laboratory, University of Florida](https://mae.ufl.edu/designlab/motors/EML2322L%20Drive%20Wheel%20Motor%20Torque%20Calculations.pdf)

The formulas are written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Calculations use Force in Newtons rather than Mass in Pounds as given in the paper.
All values are in SI units.
